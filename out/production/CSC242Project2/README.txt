Assignment: CSC 242 Project 2
Run Information:

To compile, type the following command:

bash compile.sh

To run every problem, type the following command:

java pl.driver.Driver

These are the commands to run individual problems:

java pl.driver.Driver ModusPonens

java pl.driver.Driver WumpusWorld

java pl.driver.Driver HornClauses

java pl.driver.Driver LiarsTruthersA

java pl.driver.Driver LiarsTruthersB

java pl.driver.Driver MoreLiarsTruthers


Description: We implemented truth-table enumeration and the WalkSAT algorithm on Modus Ponens, Wumpus World, Horn Clauses, Liars and Truth-Tellers, and More Liars and Truth-Tellers. Note: we used the word truthers instead of truth-tellers throughout the project (Drake & Josh Reference). 

Extra Credit: We would like our project to be considered for extra credit for doing 5 problems rather than the required 3.

Who did what?
Ali implemented the Basic Model Checking Algorithm and we both worked on the WalkSAT algorithm. Ali used the two algorithms on the Modus Ponens, Wumpus World, and Horn Clauses problems whereas James coded up the Liars Truth-Tellers and More Liars Truth-Tellers problem and configured the two algorithms to work on those problems.
